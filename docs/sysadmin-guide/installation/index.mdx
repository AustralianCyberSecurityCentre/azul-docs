# Installation

Welcome to Azul!

Azul is scoped to be able to hold a variety of content at a variety of scales, and
subsequently we provide two main ways that you can deploy Azul into your environment.

These are based on use-cases that the Australian Signal Directorate's Australian Cyber
Security Centre encounter, but your mileage may vary - let us know if there are
alternative deployments that meet your needs better!

To begin, choose a path:

<div style={{display: "grid", gridTemplateColumns: "1fr 1fr", gap: "16px"}}>
    <DocCard item={{
        type: "link",
        href: "./kubernetes/prerequisites",
        label: "Kubernetes (Recommended)",
        description: "Deploy Azul for a team of analysts or for incident response purposes"
    }} />
    <DocCard item={{
        type: "link",
        href: "./compose/",
        label: "Docker Compose",
        description: "Deploy Azul for testing or development purposes"
    }} />
</div>
