# Next Steps

Congratulations! Hopefully you now have a working deployment of Azul and
can now upload content for analysis.

Now that Azul is deployed, refer to the User Guide for more tips on
how to use Azul itself.

From here, there are a range of different things you could do:

- Use metadata from [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com) with the VT plugin
- Setup dynamic execution of content with [Cape](https://github.com/kevoreilly/CAPEv2)
- Configure reporting feeds with the report-feeds (in development) plugin
- Setup automated flows using azul-client

If you have feedback about Azul, please do raise a Discussion or Issue
on the Azul GitHub page.
