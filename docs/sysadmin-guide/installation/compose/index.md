# Docker Compose

:::warning

Kubernetes is the primary deployment configuration for Azul and is where you will get
the most benefit from Azul.

**Most plugins** are not available in Docker Compose for maintainability reasons; you
will get a reduced experience.

:::

The Docker Compose variant of Azul ("azul-demo")provides a very basic environment that
has had no security hardening applied to it.

To deploy using this technique, refer to [azul-demo's guide](../../../developer-guide/components/core/demo).
