It is NOT necessary to migrate Azul OpenSearch data to new prefixes as part of
this release.

It is NOT necessary to migrate Kafka data.

## Reliability

It is now possible to configure replica counts and pod disruption budgets for
various core Azul components. No configuration is required for this if you
are fine with defaults, but if you have high-reliability requirements or have
previously configured your own Budgets you should consider the new options
exposed for this.

## Runtime Python Configuration

It is possible to configure pip/uv for maco plugins directly in Azul's configuration.
If you are not deploying Maco or it works out of the box for you no changes
are required.

Check example-values.yaml for how to configure this.

## Kafka rack configuration

It is possible to configure Kafka's Rack setting for resiliency in the infra chart.
No change is required for this unless you have specific needs for this.

Check example-values.yaml for how to configure this.

## Docker image path

`customRegistry` has been changed to point at docker.io by default. If you have a custom
registry you now need to specify the full path to where images are stored.
